INTERPRETATION
--------------
1. If system_accuracy > baseline: Triage is beneficial
2. Higher human_accuracy → higher system_accuracy (expected)
3. Optimal threshold balances automation rate and accuracy
4. Cost analysis considers both AI errors and human review effort

Key Recommendations:
- Choose threshold balancing accuracy and automation rate
- Monitor actual human accuracy in deployment
- Periodically retrain model to improve AI performance
